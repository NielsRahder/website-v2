description_short: "As part of the core team at Tilburg Science Hub, I hope to foster better open science practices in the research community!"
description_long: "I am an assistant professor in the Marketing department at Tilburg University. My research involves causal inference in the domain of online platforms (examples include user-generated content such as reviews/ratings, non-focal prices advertised by a platform on their product page, and recommender systems). The primary methodologies I use are field experiments/quasi experiments and applied machine learning. My involvement with Tilburg Science Hub started in 2022. Since then, I have loved working with our RAs to help content creation and dissemination efforts (such as presenting at conferences and cross departmental events). Excited to see us grow!"
